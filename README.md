# 🏃‍♂️ Royal Run

**Royal Run** is a 3D endless runner game developed using Unity and C#. Players control a royal character running continuously through an obstacle-filled path, avoiding collisions and collecting items to achieve the highest score possible.

This project was built independently to improve my skills in gameplay programming, UI design, and Unity 3D development.
